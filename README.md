Application Security Handbook & Simulator

An interactive web-based security learning platform designed to help developers understand common application security vulnerabilities through realistic simulations and secure coding examples.

1.Features :-

a)Hands-on simulations for OWASP Top vulnerabilities
b)Vulnerable vs Secure code comparison (ASP.NET Core)
c)Static attack payloads (safe for learning)
d)Developer-friendly explanations
e)No real exploitation or live attack execution

2.Covered Vulnerabilities :-

a)Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
b)Rate Limiting
c)Auth Bypass
d)Path Traversal
e)Session Hijacking
f)Outdated Components
g)Access Control
h)SQL Injection (Union, Boolean, Time-based)
i)Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
j)Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)
k)File Upload Vulnerabilities
l)JWT Weak Key / Algorithm Issue

3.Learning Objective

a)This project helps developers:
b)Understand how vulnerabilities occur
d)See realistic attacker behavior
d)Learn secure coding patterns
e)Align fixes with OWASP recommendations

4.Disclaimer

This project is strictly for security awareness and secure coding education.
No real systems are attacked. All simulations are static, controlled, and safe.

Tech Stack

a)HTML, CSS (Tailwind)
b)JavaScript
c)ASP.NET Core concepts (for examples)
